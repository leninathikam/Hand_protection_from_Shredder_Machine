# Hand Protection from Shredder Machine

An intelligent safety monitoring system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect hand proximity near shredder machines.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Prevent accidents by real-time detection and alerting of unsafe hand positioning.
- **Tech:** Python, OpenCV, ML-based hand detection.

## Features

- Accurate hand localization using custom vision algorithms.
- Distance calculation, orientation detection, and event reporting.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `hand_detection.py` for real-time detection.
3. Review provided sample data (`frozen_graphs`, `protos`, `utils` directories).

## Contribution

Pull requests and improvements are welcome for research and industrial extension.
